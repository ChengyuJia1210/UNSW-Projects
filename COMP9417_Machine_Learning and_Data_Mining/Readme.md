This is the University of New South Wales 2018S1 COMP9417(Machine Learning & Data Mining) Assignment2. This is a group assignment, and the topic is the "Recommender System". Here I only show my own work. In this assignment, I used the MovieLens 100K dataset [extracted from here https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/] as my experiment data. There are two method that had been used, Pearson Colleration Similarity and Adjusted Consine Similarity.
